            <p className="text-lg text-dark-charcoal mb-4">
              Founded by NIYOMUKIZA Didier, Creative Roots Rwanda is a grassroots creative
              initiative born from the passion to unlock potential in Rwandan youth. We
              operate as a 100% volunteer-led organization, demonstrating that transformative
              change doesn’t require institutional overhead—it requires heart, dedication,
              and belief in people.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-dark-charcoal">
              We work with young people aged 10–30, in and out of school, creating safe
              spaces where art becomes a tool for self-discovery, confidence building, and
              community engagement. Whether through sculpture, painting, or personal
              storytelling, we help young people find their voice.

              A Rwanda where every young person—regardless of background or schooling

              community and future through art.
